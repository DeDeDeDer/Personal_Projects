# Personal_Projects
This GitHub holds all my personal project's that I have worked on as a past time. Project's are mainly focus
on Data Science, Insurance Pricing & Reserving fields.
<br>A mapping of these are laid out below.

What is Predictive Modelling?
<br>
It is simply the framework to integrate past data & statistics to predict 
future outcomes or project liabilities. There are 4 main techniques;
Bayesian, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines & Neural Networks.
My project's utilizes mainly Bayesian & Decision Tree techniques.
Hence, focused primarily on linear regression models.

At Its Simplest, Predictive Modelling
<br>
An article publication aimed at explaining concepts to:
<br>1. Generalised structure to Predictive Modelling
<br>2. Alternative interpretations to various statistical model metrics
<br>
<ol>The article follows the generalized framework of:</ol>
    <br>
<ol><ins>Data preparation</ins></ol>
<ol>- Preliminary data analysis, executing 4-Tier's of data cleaning.</ol>
    <br>
<ol><ins>Exploratory Data Analysis</ins></ol>
<ol> Uni- Bi- & Multi- Analysis</ol>
    <br>
<ol><ins>Model Preparation</ins></ol>
<ol>- Data stratified Train/Test splits, Hyper parameter tuning, parameter </ol>
<ol>evaluation metrics.</ol>
<ol>- Feature Engineering (Quantity & Quality), Feature evaluation metrics</ol>
    <br>
<ol><ins>Predictive Modelling (Classification Problem)</ins></ol>
<ol>- Ensembles (Hard & Soft Voting)</ol>
